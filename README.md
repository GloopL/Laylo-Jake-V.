In my design, I chose to use black and white for a clean and simple look.

The challenging part for me was working with CSS. I initially tried using Bootstrap and appreciated its efficiency, but after experimenting with different designs, I found that certain elements, like centering items, weren’t responding as expected—likely because I wasn’t using it correctly. As a result, I decided to switch to CSS, allowing me to manually adjust the design of each object.
